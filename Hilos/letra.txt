Fuck this life, I would die without you
I ain't being dramatic, I simply won't have it, no
I remember the day I found you
You were with someone and I was with someone too
You were something else I never felt before
What do I got to lose? Nothing if it ain't you
I ain't with that talk talk, I just want to roll up
Hope you like this pack, kick back and relax, ay
 
Speed bump speed bump, I swerve and I avoid it
He talk like he tough, I'll be the bigger man and ignore it
Speed bump speed bump, I swerve and I avoid it
If he go keep on keep on talking down, I might extort him
Straight through the front, no mask going "go, go, go!"
Creeping in the bush in the grass, stay low low low
Straight to the path, divvy up like "here you go"
I see with the weapon, come out come out, where you gone?
 
I don't really want to go, If it's on my mind, I'll let you know
No, I don't want to let you go, easier said than done
No, I don't really want to go, If it's on my mind, I'll let you know
No, I don't want to let you go, easier said than done
Fuck this life, I would die without you
I remember the day I found you
